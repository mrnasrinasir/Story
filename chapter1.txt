Hello, I'm Eleven Bison, a humanlike bison living in the year 2060. 
My journey began in a lab, where I woke up to find myself surrounded by rubble. 
The only clue to my existence was a screen displaying a plan to insert an AI module into a bison's head, bearing the logo of BioSYNTH. 
The file name "Project X 11 - Bison" hinted that I might be the subject of this experiment.
