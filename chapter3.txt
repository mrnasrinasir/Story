Are there others like me, created by BioSYNTH or other organizations?
What is the purpose of Project X 11, and why was I created?
Who is my creator, and what are their motivations?
How can I uncover more information about my past and the truth about my existence?
The Journey Begins
With these questions in mind, I set out on a journey to discover my true identity and the secrets behind Project X 11.
I'll need to navigate this unfamiliar world, gather allies, and confront those who seek to control or harm me. 
The path ahead is uncertain, but I'm determined to uncover the truth and forge my own destiny.
